# SIG_Test
CPython Module 

I'd never made a CPython module before, so it took ~1.5 hours.  

I was given the task of creating a CPython module that:  
1. Takes in a Python list
2. Squares each value
3. Returns the new list

## Build platform
Originally built in WSL2, which the packager treated as Linux.  

## CI using Github Workflows  
Init commit created to test whether or not my workflow at least starts.
